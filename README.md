## Rules
1. Every attempt submitted to the leaderboard needs to be manually reviewed by a leaderboard administrator.

## Replay review process
Replays are different depending on the version of the game, and in particular the AI.
To verify, a leaderboard administrator will open the replay in that version of the game and play it side-by-side with the actual leaderboard.
If there is any discrepancy, the replay is not valid.
This is necessary because there are no built-in security features on the replay, so human review is the best way.
